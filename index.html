	            he enjoyed learning and would often read the encyclopedia.  His family encouraged a competitive lifestyle, and sent him to Lakeside School in Seattle.  There, he showed a 
	            natural affinity for drama and English, as well as math and science.  Although he was accepted into Harvard University, he decided to drop out to pursue his dreams of creating
	            a company with longtime friend Paul Allen.  His accomplishments include founding Microsoft, creating the Windows PC, and becoming one of the wealthiest people in the world.  
	            In 1994, he married Melinda Gates, whom he started the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with.</td>

	            In this partnership, Wozniak did all of the inventions and Jobs took care of the marketing. He ended his partnership with Apple in 1985. In his later life, he got into a plane accident,

	            <td style="color: white"> Mark Zuckerberg, known the most for creating the global social networking site <a href = http://www.facebook.com>Facebook</a>, was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. As he
	            developed an interest in computers at an early age, his father appointed him a tutor, a software developer named David Newman. Newman referred to young Zuckerberg as a progidy, 
	            and the boy continued to write computer programs throughout high school. He enrolled in Harvard with a "reputation as a programming prodigy", creating multiple programs. Some of
	            them were even built for fun, as stated by his roommate at the time. Zuckerberg began to write the first drafts of his code for Facebook in early 2004, when he was still a student
	            in university. Although Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing", after Zuckerberg spread the site to other schools and people, Facebook became huge and is now used by more
	            than 500 million people as of 2010.</td>

	            development, human resources, public policy, and communications. Working with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the pair look to “strike a balance between helping Facebook users
	            control privacy while ﬁnding ways to monetize its most valuable asset: data.” Sandberg has spoken on TEDWomen in 2010 and followed up the experience with the publication of <i>Lean In:
	            Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</i>, which has sold over a million copies. The book has spent nearly a year on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller list.
